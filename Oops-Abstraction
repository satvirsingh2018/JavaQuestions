## Abstraction is an OOPS concept to construct the structure of the real world objects. 
  During this construction only the general states and behaviors are taken and more specific states and 
  behaviors are left aside for the implementers.
The abstraction provides a way to create user-defined data types for designing real-world objects having same properties.
Abstraction is primarily used to hide the complexity. It indicates the necessary characteristics of 
  an object that differentiates it from all other types of objects. An abstraction concentrates on the external aspect of an object. 
Types of Abstraction:
Procedural abstraction – It includes series of the instructions having the specified functions.
Data abstraction – It is set of data that specifies and describes a data object.
Control abstraction – It is program control mechanism where interior details are not specified.

Abstraction shows the relevant information and rejects the non-essential details.

Abstraction solves the issues at the design level.
Abstraction is about hiding unwanted details while showing most essential information.
Abstraction allows focussing on what the information object must contain

Abstract method can't be Private. 

package com.abstraction;
abstract class Day1 {
	
	protected abstract void testMe();
	public abstract void testMe1();
	abstract void testMe2();
	
	private void testMe3() {
		
	}

}
